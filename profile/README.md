# Welcome to cuckoo-nest
The aim of the cuckoo-nest project is to re-imagining the Nest thermostats into something new.

Google dropped support for the Gen1 / Gen2 Nest Learning Thermostats in Oct 2025. A number of owners of these devices replaces them with newer versions or alternatives from other vendors.

This is a communitiy driven project with the aim of turning these devices into something different...

There are many ideas, and these are sure to grow as the project evolves but by way of example:
 - Active scenes from home assistant
 - Control other smart home devices (strong focus on Home Assistant)
 - Receive notification of events
 - Simple alarm clock

## How do I get involved?
We suggest joining the discord server as this will have the most up to date discussions on what people are working on.
There is a list of issues that can be worked ok in the main repo: https://github.com/cuckoo-nest/cuckoo_nest/issues 

## Whats with the name
Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in the nest of other species. This seems a fitting name for the project given we want to put new software on the nest devices.
